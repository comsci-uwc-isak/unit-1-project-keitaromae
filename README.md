Planning
----------
**Defining the Problem (Topic 1.1.1)**

We are creating some project for rental car shop that can make entire check in and check out process more smooth and seamless. First of all, moving all the data and systems inside our application, so they can keep everything in one place.
This app memorizes all the car types, date and mileage. It is easier for the owner to keep everything in touch. 
Planning to make some application system with really easy installation. Since the rental shop's owner are not feeling confident with all the techy things, this app can be easily installed by attaching USB disks. After that, just activate our program inside and do all the process to execute the work.
